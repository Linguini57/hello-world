# hello-world
Hello, this is where I am going to start my journey to learn coding and data science.
My name is Richard, I am a student at Cal State Northridge studying Accounting. I have a serious thirst to learn technology skills but school does not seem to be conducive to learning multiple disparate disciplines. As a result I decided to seek out learning wherever I can find it. Feel free to give unsolicited advice as right now I basically have no tech background.
